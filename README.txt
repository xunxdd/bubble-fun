Bubble generator.

Original code from CodePen.io (http://codepen.io/anon/pen/wLasJ).

Move the mouse around and spawn particles depending on your movement.

Forked from ... then  from [Raphael Rauwolf](http://codepen.io/raphaelrauwolf/)'s Pen [Connected 2D Particles](http://codepen.io/raphaelrauwolf/pen/GbjHr/).

Modifications so that when mouse moves around, bubbles fly.
